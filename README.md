# Frontend Interview — Blog Application

**React-based Blog Application**  built as part of a **Frontend Interview / Assignment**. I wanted to showcase my skills in modern frontend development, working with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and data fetching libraries.


## About the Project

The main goal of this project was to create a **small blog app** where users can:

- See a list of the latest blog articles
- View details of a blog
- Add new blog posts via a modal form
- See loading and error states handled properly

It’s a simple app, but it covers **real-world frontend tasks** like fetching data from an API, managing state, building reusable components, and designing a responsive UI.


## Tech Stack I Used

Here’s what I used while building this project:

- **React & TypeScript** — For building components and type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** — For quick and responsive styling
- **TanStack Query** — To fetch blogs and handle loading/error states
- **Custom Hooks** — Like `useTimeAgo` to display dates nicely
- **JSON Server** — For a mock backend API
- **Shadcn/ui Components** — For UI elements like modals


## What I Learned

While building this assignment, I focused on:

- **Server-state management**: Using TanStack Query to fetch blogs efficiently  
- **Component design**: Breaking the UI into reusable components like `BlogList` and `CreateBlogModal`  
- **Styling**: Making a responsive, modern UI using Tailwind CSS  
- **User experience**: Adding hover effects, transitions, and a clean modal for adding blogs
